# Computational-Finance-and-Risk-Management

This repository contains images, code, and reports for several projects involving computational finance and risk management studied at the University of Toronto. Mean-variance portfolio optimization will be examined using a Cplex solver, and several portfolio management stratgeies such as minimum-variance (minimum risk), equally weighted, buy and hold, and various implementations of Maximum Sharpe Ratio will analyzed using historical stock data.
